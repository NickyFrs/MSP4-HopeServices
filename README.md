As the application is aimed at all ages, logical placement of buttons and understandable form fields will all be clearly tagged.

### Design
#### Structure of application  
### Logo 
The School logo in this case was not used. Instead, the name of the company was used on the left side of the navigation bar 
to continue with concept of clarity and simplicity, easily understood by all audiences.

The colours used are mostly Green, Black and White which contrast each other and give a sense of elegance and clarity throughout the platform.

### Pages, Header and Navigation 
The website platform is responsive therefore it can be view in mobile, tablets and desktops. The header and footer 
are consistent in all the pages of the platform only changing the main content area. Navigation bar / Header is also 
consistent with the navigation buttons on the top right-hand side of the screen and the name of the company on the 
top-left side of the screen.

On devices tablet and mobiles the user will be able to expand/collapse this 3 line menu button that toggles down 
to access the menu items available.

#### Footer section
The footer section only have the copyright info on the left and social media icons on the right, with space for future 
option s to be added later in the middle of the footer.

#### Wireframes
Wireframe designs show navigation concepts for Mobile and Desktop views. Since, both the navbar/header and footer are consistent
throughout the application, wireframes were developed for the above-mentioned and for the main page only as only the main section 
of the page content is changing for every page.  

__Mobile__
<details><summary>Mobile Wireframes</summary>

__Desktop__

<details><summary>Desktop Homepage Wireframes</summary>
<img src="docs\testing\wireframes\desktop\Homepage.png" alt="wireframe screenshot of app on desktop"></details>


#### Colours and fonts  
The web platform uses a white (#FFFFFF) background throughout the entire application with black font providing good contrast. 
The buttons use green color  or in some instances white and green on mouse hover. We can also see red colour in the basket icon, 
use for highlighting the quantity of items in the basket.

Most od the fonts use a cross the application is Time New Roman size 16px and a font-weight of 400. Include font like: Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica with default fall-back of Sans-Serif.

Contrast Grid was used to contrast combinations and Color Contrast Accessibility Validator used to automatically check the pages.

#### Icons
Icons use on the project are Scalable Vector Graphics (svg) from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com). These are an XML-based markup language for 
describing two-dimensional based vector graphics. As such, it's a text-based, open Web standard for describing images 
that can be rendered cleanly at any size and are designed specifically to work well with other web standards 
including CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and SMIL. SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.

Note: the above definition was taken from MDN Web Docs.

## Features  
 Since the application is very basic for educational purposes the main goal here was functionality, 
 hence why the lack of frontend design. This section looks at features which were implemented and those 
 that with further research and knowledge will add to the existing set of features.

### Existing features  
Users can:
- Register and create an account.
- Password recovery and change.
- Edit and delete their details if registered.
- Email notifications (account creation and password recovery only).
- View products. 
- Add product to basket.
- Buy/Pay products (only if registered).
- Responsive e-commerce web application.
- CSRF (cross site request forgery) prevention.
- Backend admin management dashboard (for superuser only).
- User dashboard.
- Secure encrypted payment system provided through Stripe payment gateway api.

### Future features to be added  
- Search function.
- Ability to review products.
- Ability to manage multiple addresses.
- Change/Add profile picture.
- Sorting of products and categories.
- Implement more user feedback for adding or managing items in basket.
- Email confirmation for purchases.
- Revamp the front end with more eye caching design for a better user experience.


## Database  
### Database Diagram  
Database structure diagram outlining the data structure across web application using relational database. 
The PostgresSQL database has been set up as a highly normalised database, which will provide a good structure 
to organise the users, products and orders through the use of relational tables, this approach ensures 
flexibility to incorporate other data tables whilst eliminating redundancy and any inconsistent dependencies.

Navigation menu and Categories and Product are all dependant of the relational database implemented.

![Database structure diagram](docs/testing/DBschema/databaseSchema.png)


### Sitemap   
Flowchart below shows the designed move-ability across the site for a user path for the web application. Notice that 
the any user, register or not, can browse the site and add items to the basket for purchase, but whe it comes to pay for
the added items the user have to have an account. The same goes for viewing purchases or updating user details.

![Site Flow](docs/testing/wireframes/SiteMap.png)

#### Non-logged in user
The navigation bar displays an â€˜Accountâ€™ icon, this is to allow the user to register for an account 
and then have the ability to pay for items added to the basket.
with the purchasing process.

#### Registered user
The navigation bar displays an â€˜Loginâ€™ icon, this is to allow the user to pay for items and manage account.

### User journeys  
Add any user stories here, or images something like the login/logout steps  

## Testing
A number of testing were carried out once the application was completed. Documents can 
be found in the folder " [docs](/docs/testing) " for full details of the testng carried out.

Some Unit test / coverage reports were done to the basket app views.py file as well as the store app views.py 
and model.py. The report can be viewed [here](/docs/testing/coverageReport.png) or by downloading the htmlcov 
folder from the repository and opening the index.html file.

## Deployments  
### Deploying to Heroku  
This website was developed and hosted using **GitHub pages** and stored in repositories on Github. 

PyCharm was use for the development environment and Git was installed as an extension.

 
The website was deployed using Github Pages and Heroku. To do this while in the github webpages of the project repository: 
1. on the menu that appears on the right-hand side of the page under 'Environments' you can find a link to `github-pages` with anc Active batch on the side.
2. Click on either, github-pages or Environments, it will take you to the `Deployment history` page.
3. Once on the Deployment history page on the right-hand side you will se a `View Deployment` button. 
4. Click on `View Deployment` and this will open the home page of the website in a new window.

Alternatively the links below can be use to directly open the website or go to the repositories:

Link to repositories:
[REPO - MSP4-HopeServices](https://github.com/NickyFrs/MSP4-HopeServices)

Link to Deployed Website:
[Heroku Deployment](https://msp4-hopeservices.herokuapp.com)

### Forking the GitHub Repository  
To make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account:

1) Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository you wish to fork
2) At the top of the Repository, to the right above the "Settings" link on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button and select.
3) You should now have a copy of the original repository within your GitHub account.

### Cloning repository  
#### If using VSCode:
- Log into GitHub or create an account.
- Locate the GitHub Repository.
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.
- In your local IDE open the terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
- Type 'git clone', and then paste the repository URL.
  
    i.e. git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY
- Press Enter, the local clone will be created for you.

#### if using Gidpod
- Install the GitPod Browser Extension for Chrome.
- After installation, restart the browser.
- Log into GitHub or create an account.
- Locate the GitHub Repository.
- Select the green "GitPod" button to the right corner of the repository. This will start a new gitPod 
workspace to be created using the code in GitHub.
